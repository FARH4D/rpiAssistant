# rpiAssistant
My raspberry pi home assistant project for a vertical 7 inch touchscreen of 768x1024

Uses customtkinter as well as several other libraries such as Adafruit_DHT and gpio-ir.

My home assistant has a DHT11 for checking my room's humidity and temperature, an IR receiver (for registering new remotes) and an IR emitter for sending signals such as controlling my LED strip lights.
